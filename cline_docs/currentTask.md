# Current Task - Synch GenAI PoC Setup

## Current Objectives
Setting up the initial Python project structure and core dependencies for the Synch GenAI proof of concept.

## Context
Creating a FastAPI-based application that integrates:
- Haystack 2.x for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with in-memory document store
- Google Gemini API for chat and embeddings
- Tavily search as optional fallback
- Simple UI for local demonstration

## Completed Steps
1. ✅ Created requirements.txt with pinned dependencies
2. ✅ Set up .env.example with all required environment variables
3. ✅ Created FastAPI application structure with main.py
4. ✅ Implemented Gemini API integration with custom Haystack component
5. ✅ Set up hybrid RAG pipeline with BM25 + semantic retrieval
6. ✅ Created responsive web UI for testing
7. ✅ Wrote run_local.sh script for easy startup
8. ✅ Created comprehensive README with full documentation
9. ✅ Added sample knowledge base files for demonstration

## Current Status
- ✅ Project structure complete and ready for use
- ✅ Hybrid retrieval pipeline implemented using Haystack 2.x
- ✅ Gemini integration working for both chat and embeddings
- ✅ Web UI functional with real-time query processing
- ✅ Sample data provided for immediate testing
